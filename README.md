CLI-Project

Installation Instructions:
    -bundle install
    -ruby bin/cli.rb

This is a CLI Project written as a part of the Flatiron School program.

It creates a drink menu for the user based on their input and data from TheCocktailDB API.

This project uses the free version of the API and is therefore limited to 100 drinks.

Enjoy!
